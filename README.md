# React-ColoredBoxes
This app is a small test of handling state control in a React app. It generates a set of boxes with random colors saved in "state." You can click the "Random" button to change a random box to a random color. The box that was changed will display "CHANGED", which will be removed and shown on the next box that gets changed.
