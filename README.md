# React-ColoredBoxes
This app is a small test of handling state control in a React app. It generates a set of boxes with random colors saved in "state." You can click the "Random" button to change a random box to a random color. The box that was changed will display "CHANGED", which will be removed and shown on the next box that gets changed.

## Running the App
1) Clone repo: `git clone https://github.com/mpike91/React-ColoredBoxes.git`
2) Move into directory: `cd React-ColoredBoxes/`
3) Install npm: `npm install`
4) Start app: `npm start`

## My Contribution
I was not given any starter code. I used create-react-app to generate the boilerplate code, and I created my own components and functions and css styling files.
